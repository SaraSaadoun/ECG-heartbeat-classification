# Heartbeat Signal Classification

A project to classify heartbeat signals into normal and abnormal classes using an **MLP Neural Network**.

## Features
- **Dataset**:
  - collections of heartbeat signals derived from two famous datasets in heartbeat classification, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database
  - you can access the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat
- **Goal**: Classify normal vs. abnormal signals and differentiate abnormal classes.
- **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
- **Test Accuracy**: 98%  
- Visualized loss curves and classification report.
